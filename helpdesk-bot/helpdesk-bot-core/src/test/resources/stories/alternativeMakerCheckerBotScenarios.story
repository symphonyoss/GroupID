And helpdesk_client1 can verify the ticket successfully created message in the client room
When agent1 user claims the latest ticket created
Then bot can verify the agent1 user was added to the ticket room
When agent2 agent authenticates using a certificate
And agent2 user join the conversation
Then bot can verify the agent2 user was added to the ticket room
When agent3 agent authenticates using a certificate
And agent3 user join the conversation
Then bot can verify the agent3 user was added to the ticket room
